# Contributing to Agentation

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Before You Start

We generally recommend opening an issue or discussion first, especially for larger changes. It helps us chat through the approach and avoids wasted effort.

## What We Love to See

- **Bug fixes** - Always welcome.
- **Performance improvements** - Faster is better.
- **Small, focused features** - Things that solve common problems without adding complexity.

## What's Harder to Merge

- **Large UI changes** - The toolbar UI is intentionally minimal. Changes that affect everyone's experience need to benefit everyone.
- **More options and settings** - We prefer opinionated defaults over flexibility.
- **Framework wrappers** - Agentation is React-only by design. If you're interested in Vue/Svelte/Angular support, open a discussion first.

## UI Changes

If you're thinking about adding something that requires UI work (new buttons, icons, panels), we'd recommend opening a discussion first. We're happy to help with design, including creating icons or assets if needed.

## Code Style

- Match existing patterns
- Keep PRs focused (one change per PR)

## Questions?

Open an issue or start a discussion. We're happy to talk through ideas.
